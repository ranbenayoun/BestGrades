# BestGrades

This project pulls course statistics from Michael Maltsevâ€™s [CheeseFork](https://cheesefork.cf/) and extracts key insights for any Technion course.

## ðŸ“Š What this code does:

- Calculates the **average median grade** for each course
- Identifies the **maximum grade** recorded for each course

The script processes **all MALAG courses for 2025**, including sports courses, so every Technion student can benefit from the insights.

While the main analysis focuses on **Biomedical Engineering** courses, the code supports any syllabus and can be adapted accordingly.
