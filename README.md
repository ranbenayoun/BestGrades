# BestGrades
This code taps into Michael Maltsev's Cheesfork (https://cheesefork.cf/) repository and extract the statistics about any course you'd like.


This code enable to analyze:
- The **average median grade** for each course
- The **maximum grade** recorded in each course

The script runs all the 2025 Malag courses & Sports, so every Technion student can make conclusions off it.
The main analysis is for BioMedical Engineering courses, but every other sylabus can be parsed in for analysis.
